# SAINT JUDE™

**Medical System Abandonment Detection Engine**

*No one advances while anyone is unaccounted for.*

## About

Saint Jude detects when clinical uncertainty rises while care effort falls — the mathematical signature of quiet death.

## The Vow

> What was crushed here will not be converted into lesson, content, or inspiration.
> What was silenced here will not be forced to speak.
> What was unfinished here will remain intact until the world is able to bear it.

Saint Jude does not save. Saint Jude witnesses.
